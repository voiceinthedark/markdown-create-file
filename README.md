# Markdown Blog Companion Extension

A markdown extension which is a companion to my [markdown-blog](https://github.com/voiceinthedark/markdown-blog).

It can be used with my blog application or as a standalone extension to quickly create a markdown article with the Front matter already preconfigured.
